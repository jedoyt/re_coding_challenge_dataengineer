# Coding Challenge for Data Engineer
This coding problem is a small picture of the kind of work the scraping team does and is an opportunity for you to demonstrate your skills.

Write a script to scrape data from the Idaho License Verification website: idbop.mylicense.com/verification/Search.aspx.

Please do this in Python 3 and share the code as a GitHub link.
The script should return all Pharmacists with a last name that starts with "L" as a .csv file with the following information:
- First Name
- Middle Name
- Last Name
- License Number
- License Type
- Status
- Original Issued Date
- Expiry
- Renewed

The script should be written to be able to easily adapt to returning a different license type and different last name starting letter.
